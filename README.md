# Redux PoC - A UI architecture

I've collected inspiration from a bunch of places, for example:
* https://github.com/txchen/feplay/tree/gh-pages/riot_webpack
* https://github.com/sapphiriq/riot-redux-experiments
* https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux

*And the docs at [rackt.org/redux](http://rackt.org/redux/) and [riotjs.com](http://riotjs.com)*

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```
